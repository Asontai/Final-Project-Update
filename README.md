# Final-Project-Update

Final Product: https://akerkemenilbekova.myportfolio.com/interactive-data-project

I collected data from trusted sources and organized and analyzed/structured taking into consideration three general groundings about data such as Sensitive Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis. I was mindful of the ethical implications of my analysis and presented my findings visually using various charts, graphs, and tables to enhance understanding. I prioritized my audience's needs by making my data analysis simple and avoiding unnecessary information. My data visualization is visually appealing, interactive, and easy to understand.

Regarding the challenges, I did encounter some limitations during the final weeks of refining project. Embedding Plotly figure html files on my Adobe portfolio webpage was challenging. I tried to embed it through Github and Google doc. I attempted to generate my html files into iframe since Adobe portfolio accepts iframe method, but my portfolio page couldn't read anything. So, I had to resort to using JPEG images and providing a download link for viewers if they want to interact with the figures themselves by hovering over, zooming in/out.  
I also had to refine my data by changing the structure of my csv file to avoid errors while running the code. Despite these challenges, I was able to present my data effectively and didn't feel the limitations of my data visualization skills too much. 

Moving forward, I plan to explore alternative approaches to embedding interactive visualizations on my website and continue to refine my skills in data analysis and visualization. Overall, I'm proud of the work I did on this project and am excited to apply the skills and knowledge I gained in future projects.
